# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## Project Overview
This project predicts house prices using a Linear Regression model.
The dataset contains information such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms,
living area, lot size, floors, condition, and year built.

The goal of this project is to understand the complete machine learning
workflow including data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
